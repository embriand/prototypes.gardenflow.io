## Overview
This document provides detailed procedures for developing, testing, maintaining, and troubleshooting the Garden Vision component. It serves as a comprehensive guide for developers, testers, and support teams.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Procedures

### DEV001: Setting Up Development Environment

#### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure Node.js and npm are installed
node --version  # >= 16.0.0
npm --version   # >= 8.0.0

# Verify camera access in development
# Requires HTTPS or localhost for getUserMedia API
```

#### Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Navigate to frontend project
cd /Users/emmanuelbriand/Documents/workspace/gardenflow/app.gardenflow.io

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start development server (enables camera access)
npm run dev

# 4. Verify HTTPS/localhost access
# Garden Vision requires secure context for camera API
# Development server should run on https://localhost:5173 or http://localhost:5173
```

#### Component Development Setup
```bash
# 1. Navigate to Garden Vision component
cd src/components/prototypes/garden-vision

# 2. Verify component structure
ls -la
# Should show: index.tsx, CameraModal.tsx, ResultsModal.tsx, docs/, services/, etc.

# 3. Run component tests (if available)
npm run test -- --testPathPattern=garden-vision

# 4. Enable debug mode
# In browser console:
localStorage.setItem('garden-vision-debug', 'true')
```

### DEV002: Adding New Detection Features

#### Step 1: Define New Detection Type
```typescript
// 1. Update types.ts
export interface DetectedItem {
  id: string;
  type: 'parcel' | 'zone' | 'plant' | 'structure' | 'NEW_TYPE';
  // ... existing properties
}

// 2. Add to detection constants
export const ITEM_TYPES = {
  // ... existing types
  NEW_TYPE: 'new_type'
} as const;
```

#### Step 2: Update Color Constants
```typescript
// constants/index.ts
export const COLORS = {
  // ... existing colors
  NEW_TYPE: '#HEX_COLOR'
};

export const TYPE_COLORS = {
  // ... existing mappings
  NEW_TYPE: COLORS.NEW_TYPE
};
```

#### Step 3: Implement Detection Logic
```typescript
// services/imageRecognitionService.ts
private generateRealisticDetections(analysis: ImageAnalysis): DetectedItem[] {
  const items: DetectedItem[] = [];
  
  // ... existing detection logic
  
  // Add new detection logic
  const newTypeItems = this.detectNewType(analysis);
  items.push(...newTypeItems);
  
  return items;
}

private detectNewType(analysis: ImageAnalysis): DetectedItem[] {
  // Implement specific detection algorithm
  // Return array of DetectedItem objects
}
```

#### Step 4: Update UI Components
```typescript
// ResultsModal.tsx - Add new type display
const getItemIcon = (type: string) => {
  switch (type) {
    // ... existing cases
    case 'NEW_TYPE':
      return <NewTypeIcon className="w-4 h-4" />;
  }
};

const getItemLabel = (type: string) => {
  switch (type) {
    // ... existing cases
    case 'NEW_TYPE':
      return 'New Type Label';
  }
};
```

#### Step 5: Testing
```bash
# 1. Unit tests for detection logic
npm run test -- --testPathPattern=imageRecognitionService

# 2. Integration tests
npm run test -- --testPathPattern=garden-vision

# 3. Manual testing with sample images
# Place test images in: src/assets/test-images/
# Test various scenarios: good lighting, poor lighting, edge cases
```

---

### DEV003: Performance Optimization

#### Image Processing Optimization
```typescript
// 1. Optimize canvas operations
private optimizeImageProcessing(imageData: ImageData): void {
  // Use Web Workers for heavy processing
  const worker = new Worker('/workers/image-processing.js');
  
  // Implement progressive processing
  // Process image in chunks to maintain UI responsiveness
}

// 2. Memory management
private cleanupResources(): void {
  // Stop camera streams
  if (this.stream) {
    this.stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
  }
  
  // Clear canvas data
  if (this.canvas) {
    const ctx = this.canvas.getContext('2d');
    ctx?.clearRect(0, 0, this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height);
  }
}
```

#### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Add performance markers
performance.mark('garden-vision-start');
// ... processing logic
performance.mark('garden-vision-end');
performance.measure('garden-vision-total', 'garden-vision-start', 'garden-vision-end');

// Log performance metrics
console.log('Processing time:', performance.getEntriesByName('garden-vision-total')[0].duration);
```

const performanceTest = async () => {
  const testImages = [
    { name: 'small', size: '640x480' },
    { name: 'medium', size: '1280x720' },
    { name: 'large', size: '1920x1080' }
  ];
  
  for (const image of testImages) {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    await imageRecognitionService.processImage(image.data);
    const endTime = performance.now();
    
    console.log(`${image.name}: ${endTime - startTime}ms`);
  }
};

// Target performance:
// Small (640x480): < 1 second
// Medium (1280x720): < 3 seconds  
// Large (1920x1080): < 5 seconds
```

#### Memory Usage Testing
```javascript
// Monitor memory usage during processing
const monitorMemory = () => {
  if (performance.memory) {
    console.log('Used:', performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize);
    console.log('Total:', performance.memory.totalJSHeapSize);
    console.log('Limit:', performance.memory.jsHeapSizeLimit);
  }
};

// Test for memory leaks
// Capture multiple images and monitor memory growth

3. Check site permissions in browser
4. Test on different browsers

# Common causes:
- HTTP instead of HTTPS in production
- Browser blocking camera access
- Site permissions revoked by user
- Corporate firewall blocking media

# Solutions:
- Ensure HTTPS in production
- Clear browser data and retry
- Guide user through permission reset
- Check network/firewall settings
```

#### Problem: Camera Not Found
```bash
# Diagnosis steps:
1. Check if device has camera
2. Verify camera not in use by other apps
3. Test camera in other applications
4. Check device permissions (mobile)

# Common causes:
- No camera device available
- Camera in use by another application
- Device permissions disabled
- Hardware failure

# Solutions:
- Verify device capabilities
- Close other applications using camera
- Check device-level permissions
- Suggest device restart
